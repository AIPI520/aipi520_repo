# Modeling Process and Algorithms (AIPI 520) Course Repo
Welcome to the GitHub repo for AIPI 520: Modeling Process and Algorithms at Duke University.  This repo accompanies the course, which is part of [Duke's AI Master of Engineering program](http://ai.meng.duke.edu) and is taught by [Jon Reifschneider](https://ai.meng.duke.edu/faculty/jon-reifschneider).  This course is designed as an introduction to the process of building machine learning models and a tour of the main ML algorithms in use today, including both their theoretical underpinnings and their practical implementation.  The focus of the course is on the classical ML techniques although two weeks are dedicated to deep learning.

This repo contains code notebooks with code examples which accompany the course as well as in-class exercises which we will complete during the scheduled lecture sessions.  Assignments will be distributed separately via Sakai and GitHub Classroom.
